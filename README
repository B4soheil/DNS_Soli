DNS Soli is a highly configurable DNS proxy for Penetration Testers and Malware Analysts. A DNS proxy (aka "Fake DNS") is a tool used for application network traffic analysis among other uses. For example, a DNS proxy can be used to fake requests for "+++++" to point to a local machine for termination or interception instead of a real host somewhere on the Internet. 

There are several DNS Proxies out there. Most will simply point all DNS queries a single IP address or implement only rudimentary filtering. DNSSoli was developed as part of a penetration test where there was a need for a more configurable system. As a result, DNSSoli is cross-platform application capable of forging responses based on inclusive and exclusive domain lists, supporting multiple DNS record types, matching domains with wildcards, proxying true responses for nonmatching domains, defining external configuration files, IPv6 and many other features. You can find detailed explanation of each of the features and suggested uses below.

The use of DNS Proxy is recommended in situations where it is not possible to force an application to use some other proxy server directly. For example, some mobile applications completely ignore OS HTTP Proxy settings. In these cases, the use of a DNS proxy server such as DNSSoli will allow you to trick that application into forwarding connections to the desired destination.

Setting up a DNS Proxy
======================

Before you can start using DNS Soli, you must configure your machine to use a DNS nameserver with the tool running on it. You have several options based on the operating system you are going to use:

* **Linux** - Edit */etc/resolv.conf* to include a line on the very top with your traffic analysis host (e.g add "nameserver 127.0.0.1"  if you are running locally). Alternatively, you can add a DNS server address using tools such as Network Manager. Inside the Network Manager open IPv4 Settings, select *Automatic (DHCP) addresses only* or *Manual* from the *Method* drop down box and edit *DNS Servers* text box to include an IP address with DNSSoli running.

* **Windows** - Select *Network Connections* from the *Control Panel*. Next select one of the connections (e.g. "Local Area Connection"), right-click on it and select properties. From within a newly appearing dialog box, select *Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)* and click on properties. At last select *Use the following DNS server addresses* radio button and enter the IP address with DNSSoli running. For example, if running locally enter 127.0.0.1.

* **OS X** - Open *System Preferences* and click on the *Network* icon. Select the active interface and fill in the *DNS Server* field. If you are using Airport then you will have to click on *Advanced...* button and edit DNS servers from there. Alternatively, you can edit */etc/resolv.conf* and add a fake nameserver to the very top there (e.g "nameserver 127.0.0.1").

* **iOS** - Open *Settings* and select *General*. Next select on *Wi-Fi* and click on a blue arrow to the right of an active Access Point from the list. Edit DNS entry to point to the host with DNSSoli running. Make sure you have disabled Cellular interface (if available).

* **Android** - Open *Settings* and select *Wireless and network*.  Click on *Wi-Fi settings* and select *Advanced* after pressing the *Options* button on the phone. Enable *Use static IP* checkbox and configure a custom DNS server.
